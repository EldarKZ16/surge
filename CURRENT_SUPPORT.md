# Our Current Support Model

Surge is in a pre-release state. While things are moving around and we figure out our support model we want to call out a few things to be aware of.

## Pull Requests & Issues

Our team will make their best effort to get to any issues or pull requests open by contributors. We sincerely appreciate any contributions and ideas, but our small team is currently focusing on getting Surge ready for widespread adoption across UKG so we may be delayed in reviewing any changes or addressing any issues. This means that while we will try our best to be prompt, we cannot make any guarantees on turnaround time for a particular PR review or a fix for a particular issue.

## API Stability

While we do use [MiMa](https://github.com/lightbend/mima) to check binary compatibility of incoming pull requests we are still actively developing and reworking the Surge APIs as we work towards making them cleaner & more easily consumable. While we will try our best to keep things backwards compatible as much as possible, in its pre-release state we can make no guarantees of fully backwards compatible APIs.
